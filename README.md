## Pony-tony game - 2 Player game

This project is a 2-player Ping-Pong game developed using C# and MonoGame. The game offers an engaging and exciting experience for users who want to enjoy a classic game of Ping-Pong.

The game was designed with a focus on Object Oriented Programming principles, resulting in a modular and extensible codebase that makes it easy to maintain and update.

One of the key challenges of developing a Ping-Pong game is ensuring a smooth 2-player interaction. To achieve this, we implemented complex algorithms and math calculations that enable seamless gameplay. We also tested and documented critical algorithms to ensure game functionality and utilized automated and manual testing methods to verify code quality.

In addition to ensuring game functionality, we optimized game performance through algorithm and data structure improvements. This optimization reduced lag and increased overall responsiveness, providing a better gaming experience for users.

We are confident that this Ping-Pong game will provide an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience for players of all ages.
